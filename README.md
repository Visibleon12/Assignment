# Assignment


I have assumed map as an 2D array of some square meter and used websockets for the real time location tracks sending.


Api end points:
                                                    req                          res
                                                    
1. /api/getLocation/:lat&:lon                       10,20                      [{10,20},{30,20}]


To run the app clone the repository and the run npm install and the run the app on local host 5000
